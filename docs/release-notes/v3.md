## v3 Prologue

V3 of LAMS is a relatively straightforward major change that opts in to many of the underlying LookML Parser's output options that have accumulated over time.

The primary impact will be to LAMS users who have implemented [custom rules](https://looker-open-source.github.io/look-at-me-sideways/customizing-lams), who may have to update their rules for the updated LookML representations.

Usage of LAMS that only uses the "out of the box" style guide rules should not see any impact, except that some rules may now work correctly based on extensions/refinements, whereas they may have thrown "false positive" errors previously because the parser did not apply any extensions/refinements.

## Highlighted changes

- **Extensions/refinements awareness.** - 
- **Whitespace/comment awareness available.** Although no standard rules pertain to whitespace/comments, custom rules may now elect to evaluate whitespace by looking at the `$strings` property within each object.
- **File representation simplification.** Files were previously represented as an array. The ordering was not particularly significant. The lack of a meaningful key made the location returned in custom rules opaque and necessitated workarounds. Now, files are represented by an object, keyed by the filename.
