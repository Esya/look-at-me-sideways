# v3.0

## v3 Prologue

V3 of LAMS is a relatively straightforward but major change that opts in to many of the underlying LookML Parser's output options that have accumulated over time.

The primary impact will be to LAMS users who have implemented [custom rules](https://looker-open-source.github.io/look-at-me-sideways/customizing-lams), who may have to update their rules for the updated LookML representations.

Usage of LAMS that only uses the "out of the box" style guide rules should not see a large impact, except that some rules may now work correctly based on extensions/refinements, whereas they may have thrown "false positive" errors previously because the parser did not apply any extensions/refinements.

## Highlighted changes

- **Extensions/refinements awareness.** - 
- **Whitespace/comment awareness available.** Although no built-in rules pertain to whitespace/comments, custom rules may now elect to evaluate whitespace by looking at the `$strings` property within each object.
- **File representation simplification.** Files were previously represented as an array. The ordering was not particularly significant. The lack of a meaningful key made the location returned in custom rules opaque and necessitated workarounds. Now, files are represented by an object, keyed by the filename.

## Changelist

- Built-in rule updates
	- F1: Rule F1 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
- JSON Path library update
	- The JSON Path library has been migrated from `jsonpath`, which was rarely maintained, to `jsonpath-plus`. This is primarily to address the old library's failure to correctly match union expressions, which were a common use case for expressions like `$.model.*['dimension','measure'].*`

## Migration Guidelines

For any error not detailed below, please submit an issue!

- If you are providing any custom rules that iterate over file matches
	- 
- If you have newly-erroring views that were previously unchecked due to their not being in a view file
	- You may wish to update the view to comply with the style guide, or apply exemptions for the relevant rule(s)
