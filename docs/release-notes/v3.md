# v3.0

## v3 Prologue

V3 of LAMS is a relatively straightforward but major change that opts in to many of the underlying LookML Parser's output options that have accumulated over time.

The primary impact will be to LAMS users who have implemented [custom rules](https://looker-open-source.github.io/look-at-me-sideways/customizing-lams), who may have to update their rules for the updated LookML representations.

Usage of LAMS that only uses the "out of the box" style guide rules should not see a large impact, except that some rules may now work correctly based on extensions/refinements, whereas they may have thrown "false positive" errors previously because the parser did not apply any extensions/refinements.

## Highlighted changes

- **Extensions/refinements awareness.** - 
- **Whitespace/comment awareness available.** Rules may now elect to evaluate whitespace by looking at the `$strings` property within each object. An initial built-in rule pertaining to whitespce, W1, is also included in the release.
- **File representation simplification.** Files were previously represented as an array. The ordering was not particularly significant. The lack of a meaningful key made the location returned in custom rules opaque and necessitated workarounds. Now, files are represented by an object, keyed by the filename.

## Changelist

- Built-in rule updates
	- F1: Rule F1 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
	- F2: Rule F2 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
	- F3: Rule F3 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
	- F4: Rule F4 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
	- K1: Rule K1 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models. It now also contains logic that was previously identified as K2.
	- K2: Rule identifier K2 is deprecated, and its rule logic is applied under K1.
	- K3: Rule K3 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
	- K4: Rule K4 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
	- T1: Rule T1 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
	- W1: Rule W1 is added as an initial rule demonstrating the ability to operate on whitespace.
- JSON Path library update
	- The JSON Path library has been migrated from `jsonpath`, which was rarely maintained, to `jsonpath-plus`. This is primarily to address the old library's failure to correctly match union expressions, which were a common use case for expressions like `$.model.*['dimension','measure'].*`
	- Javascript expressions within path components are strictly limited to a single existence check or equality check against a literal


## Migration Guidelines

For any error not detailed below, please submit an issue!

- If you are providing any custom rules that iterate over file matches
	- 
- If you have newly-erroring views that were previously unchecked due to their not being in a view file
	- You may wish to update the view to comply with the style guide, or apply exemptions for the relevant rule(s)
